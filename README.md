# Podman Pilot üöÄ

Podman Pilot is a shell-based TUI (Text User Interface) management script for Podman on Debian-based systems. It aims to simplify common Podman operations like installation, managing registries, pods, images, containers, and deploying predefined applications with a single click.

The script is designed to be modular and extensible, with support for internationalization (i18n).
